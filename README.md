# Text-summarization-with-customization
The project aims to develop a system that condenses textual content while preserving its essence, tailored to user preferences, contexts, and needs. It ensures summaries accurately reflect the original meaning by considering the text's theme, tone, and audience, maintaining the core message despite shortening.
